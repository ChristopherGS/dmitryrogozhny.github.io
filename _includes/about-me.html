        Hi! My name is Dmitry Rogozhny.
    </p>

        I am a software developer.

        I help companies to implement complex web and enterprise applications. I have experience in building intranets and extranets,
        content and document management solutions, portfolio and project management systems, BI and reporting tools.

        For over 10 years, I've had a pleasure of delivering projects for companies in oil&#8239;&&#8239;gas, banking, and telecom
        industries. I've been working as a developer, architect, and a consultant.

        I like learning new things and I like helping others to learn.
