            Training and Documentation
        </h3>
        <p>
            I will provide a training for intranet administrators and content editors. The training is a remote session
            with a Q&A session. The recording will be available afterwards.
            *Administrators are responsible for managing access and creating new sites.
            *Content editors create news and events, upload documents, add and modify pages on sites.

            The documentation includes a governance guide and how to scenarios.
            The governance guide covers the configuration performed for the intranet as well as a guidance on how to
            extend the intranet in the future.
            How to scenarios cover most popular scenarios for administrators and content editors (e.g. how to create new
            sites, manage access, modify content on sites).

                <li>
                    We will have a call, where we will discuss your requirements and I will show you a possible intranet
                    configuration.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If the configuration suits you, we can start the configuration project.
                </li>
                <li>
                    During the project, I will do the configuration in your environment. This will include 2&ndash;3
                    additional calls to discuss your requirements.

            Contact me -> discuss and demo for applicability -> if ok, then sign up the contract -> discuss structure
            and
            main requirements (go through a set of questions via phone call or fill in survey) -> configuration on your
            platform -> training for admins and content editors -> support for 2 weeks for content entry and initial
            launch
            preparation.
            <br>
            Additional services are available after that, if needed. They include additional sites and services
            configuration, automation with Flow, custom application development, ongoing support.

        <h2>Will it work for my company?</h2>
        <p>
            This approach works great for small and medium sized companies. Large companies may have requirements that
            are
            better covered by solutions from 3rd party vendors.
            For example, multilingual pages support in SharePoint Online is better with external solutions.
