[Build](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/build) is the annual Microsoft conference for developers. This year's sessions are available in this [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrxD0HtieHg7uB3_amVXvaRgxIcXLtYD).

### Honorable Mentions

I recommend watching all the keynote sessions, as they give a quick overview of all the things that were covered during the conference.
This year at Build the main topics were: Azure services, Office 365, and Microsoft tools for developers.

The Vision keynote session hosted by Satya Nadella:

### My Personal Top 5
 Here's the list of sessions I liked the most in no particular order.

__From startups to big business: Using functional programming techniques to transform line-of-business applications__
{% include youtube.html id="dSCzCaiWgLM" %}

__Leveraging SharePoint as a development platform for the modern intranet__
{% include youtube.html id="IVTYptFl_ww" %}

__What's New in TypeScript__
{% include youtube.html id="hDACN-BGvI8" %}

__Visual Studio Code Can Do That: Tips & Tricks__
{% include youtube.html id="OOG3xcUQY5k" %}

__Git patterns and anti-patterns for successful developers__
{% include youtube.html id="ykZbBD-CmP8" %}

There are much more great sessions available. The easiest way would be to check sessions by title in the [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrxD0HtieHg7uB3_amVXvaRgxIcXLtYD).
There is a [sessions page](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/events/build/content) on Build 2018 site that allows to search sessions by topics and areas of interest, but the searching there is quite quirky.

Happy watching!
