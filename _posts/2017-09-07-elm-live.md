Today is a quick tip on how to use [`elm-live`](https://github.com/tomekwi/elm-live). I highly recommend this tool as it speeds up the development process.

The [`elm-live`](https://github.com/tomekwi/elm-live) is a local server for Elm. It is similar to `elm-reactor`, but it gives you a live reloading in addition to a local web server.

## Installing `elm-live`
`elm-live` uses `npm` for installation, so you'd need [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.

You can install `elm-live` either globally or locally:
{% highlight bash %}
# Globally for a user:
npm install --global elm elm-live

# â€¦or locally for a project:
npm install --save-dev elm elm-live
{% endhighlight %}

I personally prefer a local installation for each Elm project.

## Running `elm-live`

If installed globally, you can run it using the following command:
{% highlight bash %}
$ elm-live Main.elm --open

# to compile into a separate JavaScript file and use custom HTML
$ elm-live Main.elm --output=main.js --open
{% endhighlight %}


To run locally you can call `elm-live` like this:
{% highlight bash %}
$ node ".\node_modules\elm-live\bin\elm-live.js" Main.elm --output=main.js --open
{% endhighlight %}

Once running, you can access your application at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000). If you'll change your Elm code, `elm-live` will rebuild the project and will reload a page.

This is a tool that makes working with Elm easier.
