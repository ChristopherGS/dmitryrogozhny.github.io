Now it is possible to add "`mailto:`" links in SharePoint Pages content. You can do that in text web parts by inserting a link with "`mailto:`".

This is a small change and is not reflected in the Office 365 roadmap, but the comment about that has been added to the corresponding [user voice request](https://sharepoint.uservoice.com/forums/329214-sites-and-collaboration/suggestions/33391909-enable-tel-and-mailto-links-in-editor) (btw, "`tel:`" links are still not supported).

I want to remind that you can also specify a "`mailto:`" link for an Image web part. Quick Links web part does not support "`mailto:`" links.
