Here's how I get text, images, illustrations, and videos for my demos and prototypes.

### Text

I try to write a meaningful text for all demos and I recommend you to do the same. A real text is way better than [lorem ipsum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorem_ipsum).

If your current demo doesn't require a real text, use a [lorem ipsum generator](https://www.lipsum.com/) to get some lorem ipsum text. This text is common enough to be recognized as a placeholder and it won't distract viewers.

**Tip**: you can use Office 365 Word to generate random content. Type `=rand()` in a document and it will generate some random content. You can specify the number of paragraphs to generate in brackets:

### Images

For images I use [unsplash.com](https://unsplash.com) most of the time. This site provides free to use high-quality images.

If I want to emphasize that an image is a placeholder, I use images generated by [placeholder.com](https://placeholder.com/).

It is possible to define the size, extension, background color, and text for an image. For example, the [https://via.placeholder.com/550x100](https://via.placeholder.com/550x100) url will return the following image:
![automatically generated placeholder image](https://via.placeholder.com/550x100){: .image--original-size-small}

### Illustrations

For illustrations I use [undraw.co](https://undraw.co). It is similar to [unsplash.com](https://unsplash.com) but provides a collection of free to use illustrations.

### Videos

I use [coverr.co](https://coverr.co/) for demo videos.
