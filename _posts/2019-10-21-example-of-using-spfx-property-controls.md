[`@pnp/spfx-property-controls`](https://sharepoint.github.io/sp-dev-fx-property-controls/) is an open-sourced project from the SharePoint PnP team that provides a set of reusable property pane controls. You can use these controls in your SharePoint Framework (SPFx) projects. The project can save you a lot of time, if you are implementing SPFx web parts.

If you've never used `@pnp/spfx-property-controls` or just started looking at it, the following demo might be useful for you.

It contains two web parts that give an example of how to add property page controls to a project and how to later use entered values in your code.

Here's how web parts look like:

![Reusable controls with callout panel]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2019/reusable-controls-with-callout.jpg)


The source code is available in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dmitryrogozhny/sharepoint-lab/tree/master/spfx-property-controls-review).
